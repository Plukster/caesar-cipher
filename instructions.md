# Caesar Cipher Instructions

## Project Description
Alice and Bob are bored during classes and want to exchange secret messages. They decided to use the Caesar cipher to avoid teachers reading their notes.

## How Caesar Cipher Works
- Each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet
- For example, with a shift of 3: A → D, B → E, C → F, etc.
- When reaching the end of the alphabet, it wraps around (Z → C)

## Requirements
1. Implement encryption function
2. Implement decryption function  
3. Handle both uppercase and lowercase letters
4. Preserve spaces and punctuation
5. Support shift values from 0 to 25
